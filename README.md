## Setup

### Project Requirements/Dependencies
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is usually installed automatically with Node.js. You can check if you have npm installed by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
- **Express.js**: Version 4.18.2 or higher.
- **Socket.IO**: Version 4.7.4 or higher.
- **Chakra UI**: Version 2.8.2 or higher.
- **React**: Version 18.2.0 or higher.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: 

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the cloned project:

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**: Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:
`cd backend`
`npm install`

4. **Install Frontend Dependencies**: Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:
`cd ../frontend`
`npm install`

5. **Start the Backend Server**: Go back to the root directory and start the backend server:
`cd ..`
`npm start`

6. **Start the Frontend Server**: Open another terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the frontend server:
`cd frontend`
`npm run dev`

<!-- 7. **Access the Application**: Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the chat application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. -->

Now, you should have the project set up and running locally on your machine. You can start exploring the features of the chat application and customize it further as needed. If you encounter any issues during the setup process, make sure to check the console for error messages and troubleshoot accordingly.

## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by how easy and smooth it is to chat on apps like WhatsApp and Instagram. Seeing how people connect and share things on these apps gave me the idea to create a chat app that's just as simple and helpful. I wanted to understand how they make it work so well and build something similar.
- Special thanks to the developers of Socket.IO for their powerful real-time communication library.
- Many thanks to some YouTubers whose tutorials provided valuable solutions when I encountered challenges    during development.
